            <h2>My Top Four Personal Values</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Listening</h3>
                <p>1. talking rather than listening can cause more problems than just addressing the issue.</p>
                <p>2. I have worked with people that have no issue interupting the authority as they are explaining what to do next on the job site.</p> 
                <p>3. This is not just aggrivating to listen to, but it can get in the way of just going ahead and getting the job done right the first time.</p>
                <p>4. I developed this value by working with people that have no issue interupting the authority as the authority is explaining what to do next on the job site.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Hard Work</h3>
                <p>1. Hard work is always appreciated and often rewarded.</p>
                <p>2. The harder you work the faster you get the job done.</p>
                <p>3. If all people had the same idea and motivation as me with hard work, jobs would be done a lot faster.</p>
                <p>4. When I was working on construction sites in the heat of the day. I always made sure to work hard, because if I got the job done fast I could got off early.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Efficiency through asking questions</h3>
                <p>1. Time is Money</p>
                <p>2. Asking the right questions in the workplace leads to increased productivity.</p>
                <p>3. When people ask questions to people with more years experience, it can help them understand more productive ways the get a job done fast and correctly.</p>
                <p>4. I learned this value when I was installing the sound system at a football field. I was having trouble with part of the install, in other words my way was inefficient. So I asked my supervisor how he would get the job done. I took his word and got the job done way quicker.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>understanding
                <p>1. Understanding is an important value because it helps build empathy and stronger relationships between people.</p>
                <p>2. It allows us to see situations from others' perspectives, reducing conflict and promoting harmony.</p>
                <p>3. Ultimately, it creates a foundation for cooperation, learning, and meaningful connection.</p>
                <p>4. One week while working on a sound system in a school. I got sick with Covid. This slowed me down tremendously. My supervisor seeing my condition let me go home early and get some rest. Without the Supervisors understanding I don't know how I would have gotten through the rest of the day.</p>
