                <h3>What is GE Aerospace</h3>
                <p>GE Aerospace is a leading global provider of jet engines, components, and integrated systems for commercial and military aircraft. Known for its engineering innovation and advanced manufacturing, the company designs, builds, and services engines that power many of the world’s most important air fleets. GE Aerospace also drives developments in digital analytics and sustainable aviation technologies, helping improve performance, fuel efficiency, and reliability across the aviation industry.</p>

                <h3>What do I do for GE</h3>
                <p>A Mechanical Engineer Designer at GE Aerospace helps develop and improve the components and systems used in aircraft engines. They create detailed 3D models and technical drawings, select materials, and work closely with manufacturing and testing teams to ensure parts can be produced reliably and meet strict safety and performance standards. Their role combines problem-solving, precision engineering, and collaboration to support the development of high-efficiency, high-reliability aerospace systems.</p>

                <h3>Possible ethical issue</h3>
                <p>One ethical issue that could occur in the aerospace field is pressure to overlook or minimize a design flaw to meet deadlines or cost targets. Because aircraft engine components must meet extremely high safety standards, even small performance concerns need to be reported and addressed. However, an engineer might face pressure—whether direct or indirect—from management or project timelines to pass a part that hasn’t been fully validated or to adjust data to make results look acceptable.</p>

                <h3>cybersecurity issues</h3>
                <p>1. Unauthorized Access to Proprietary Designs:
GE Aerospace handles highly sensitive engine models, material specifications, and manufacturing processes. If a hacker or insider gains access to this confidential data, it could be stolen, copied, or sold, leading to loss of competitive advantage and potential national security risks. Protecting designs with strong access controls, encryption, and monitoring is essential.</p>
                <p>2. Ransomware or System Disruption:
If malicious software infects the company’s network or production systems, it could lock engineers and manufacturing teams out of critical tools or halt assembly lines. This not only delays production but could also compromise safety-related testing data. Regular backups, employee training, and strong network security help prevent and respond to these attacks.</p>
                <h3>Best Cybersecurity Practices</h3>
                <p>Cybersecurity best practices in the aerospace industry focus on protecting sensitive designs, operational systems, and communication networks from unauthorized access or disruption. Companies use strong authentication methods, encrypted data storage, and strict access controls to ensure only approved personnel can view or modify critical information. Regular employee training helps prevent phishing and social engineering attacks, while continuous system monitoring and threat detection tools help identify suspicious activity quickly. Additionally, organizations frequently back up critical data and maintain incident response plans to ensure they can recover safely and efficiently if a cybersecurity breach occurs.</p>
